## My Participation
## Detailed Participation in #30DayChartChallenge 2024

Throughout the #30DayChartChallenge in April 2024, I engaged in creating a diverse range of data visualizations using R and ggplot2. Each day focused on a different theme, pushing the boundaries of data storytelling. Here is a summary of my contributions:

- **Day 8 (circular )**: Explored the fouls committed by teams in the Premier League using a circular format to highlight differences in home and away fouls.
- **Day 9 (major/minor)**: Created a line chart comparing different shot types among Premier League teams, showing that more shots don't always lead to more goals.
- **Day 10 (physical)**: Visualized match outcomes for the Premier League season, demonstrating how results developed over time.
- **Day 11 (mobile-friendly)**: Investigated the distribution of corner kicks across different teams using box plots to show variability and outliers.
- **Day 12 (Reuters Graphics - theme day)**: Presented a bar chart to compare home and away goal differentials, illustrating which teams performed better in different settings.
- **Day 13 (family)**: Used clustering techniques to uncover relationships between teams based on their scoring patterns at home and away.
- **Day 14 (heatmap)**: Created a heatmap to analyze shooting accuracy and chance conversion across teams, highlighting efficiency in front of goal.
- **Day 15 (historical)**: Tracked the historical points race in the Premier League, offering insights into the progression of team performances throughout the season.
- **Day 16 (weather)**: Developed a metaphorical visualization using the number of goals scored per game to descriptively categorize and label each match.
- **Day 17 (networks)**: Created a network analysis of one of the most iconic anime battles, illustrating the connections and power levels in the fight between Goku and Frieza.
- **Day 18 (Asian Development Bank - data day)**: Analyzed economic recovery in Central Asia and the Caucasus using GDP data, visualizing trends to 2025.
- **Day 19 (dinosaurs)**: Depicted the release timeline of "The Land Before Time" movies, showcasing the longevity of the series.
- **Day 20 (correlation)**: Performed a cross-correlation analysis on climate data to understand the relationship between temperature and precipitation.
- **Day 21 (green energy)**: Mapped the rollout of electric cars by major manufacturers, highlighting the growth and expansion of the electric vehicle market.
- **Day 22 (mobility)**: Visualized the oldest operational transport lines worldwide, emphasizing the evolution of public transport infrastructure.
- **Day 23 (tiles)**: Analyzed hotel booking data to compare occupancy and cancellation rates across different months, using a creative tile plot design.
- **Day 30 (FiveThirtyEight - theme day)**: Explored the digital contact channels of Ecuador's tourism industry, detailing the engagement across various sectors.

These projects reflect not only technical skills in data manipulation and visualization but also a deep interest in telling compelling stories through data. Each folder within this repository contains the respective R scripts and visual outputs for detailed review.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or need further details about any of the visualizations.

These entries represent my effort to explore different aspects of data visualization and enhance my skills in using R for effective storytelling through data.
